The provided code appears to be written in ABAP, a programming language used in SAP systems. There doesn't seem to be any syntax errors in the code snippet you provided. However, a few suggestions and improvements can be made:

The function name z_right_angle_triangle should be in lowercase letters, following standard naming conventions.
The comment section above the function definition could be improved by adding a brief description of what the function does.
The usage of "TYPE I" for the parameters A, B, and C could be replaced with specific data types like TYPE I for integers or other appropriate data types as per the requirement.
Since the RETURN_VALUE parameter is of type C, it can only hold a single character. You may want to consider using a different data type if you need to return more than one character.
It's recommended to use meaningful variable names instead of square_a, square_b, and square_c to improve code readability.
Here's an updated version with these suggestions:


FUNCTION z_right_angle_triangle.

*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING

  DATA: square_a TYPE i,
        square_b TYPE i,
        square_c TYPE i.

  square_a = I_A * I_A.
  square_b = I_B * I_B.
  square_c = I_C * I_C.

  E_RETURN_VALUE = ' '.
  IF square_a = square_b + square_c OR square_b = square_a + square_c OR square_c = square_a + square_b.
    E_RETURN_VALUE = 'X'.
  ENDIF.

ENDFUNCTION.
These changes are just suggestions to improve the code's readability and maintainability. The original code is syntactically correct and should work as intended.
