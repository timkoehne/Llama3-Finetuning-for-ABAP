The provided code contains some syntax errors. Here are the issues:

The FUNCTION keyword should be written in lowercase: "FUNCTION" should be changed to "function".
The word "ENDFUNCTION" should be written in lowercase: "ENDFUNCTION" should be changed to "endfunction".
In the FUNCTION header, the "EXPORTING" section should not include VALUE keyword before "RETURN_VALUE". It should be written as "EXPORTING RETURN_VALUE TYPE C".
The "VALUE" keyword is not required in the IMPORTING section. It should be written as "IMPORTING A TYPE I", "IMPORTING B TYPE I", and "IMPORTING C TYPE I".
The variables "a", "b", and "c" should be declared in the "DATA" section since they are used in the code, and they are part of the local interface. The declaration can be added as follows:

  DATA: a TYPE i,
        b TYPE i,
        c TYPE i,
        square_a TYPE i,
        square_b TYPE i,
        square_c TYPE i.
After making these corrections, the code should look like this:


function z_right_angle_triangle.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(A) TYPE  I
*"     VALUE(B) TYPE  I
*"     VALUE(C) TYPE  I
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(RETURN_VALUE) TYPE  C
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------

  DATA: a TYPE i,
        b TYPE i,
        c TYPE i,
        square_a TYPE i,
        square_b TYPE i,
        square_c TYPE i.

  square_a = a * a.
  square_b = b * b.
  square_c = c * c.

  return_value = ' '.
  if square_a = square_b + square_c or square_b = square_a + square_c or square_c = square_a + square_b.
    return_value = 'X'.
  endif.

endfunction.
With these changes, the code should be free of syntax errors.
