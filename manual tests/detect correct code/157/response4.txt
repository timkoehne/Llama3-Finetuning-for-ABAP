The given code snippet appears to be ABAP code, which is a programming language used in SAP systems. Upon reviewing the code, there are no obvious syntax errors. However, here are a few observations and recommendations:

The function name should start with a letter, not a digit. It's generally a good practice to use meaningful names that start with a letter and follow camelCase or snake_case convention. For example, z_right_angle_triangle could be renamed to something like check_right_angle_triangle.

The comment section at the beginning (*"Local Interface:) is typically used to document the function's interface (parameters and return values). Ensure that it correctly reflects the actual parameters and return values being used in the function.

It's generally a good idea to handle invalid input scenarios, such as negative values for a, b, or c. You can add validations or error handling if necessary.

Other than these points, there are no syntax errors in the given code snippet. It checks whether the provided lengths a, b, and c form a right-angled triangle and sets the return_value to 'X' if true.
