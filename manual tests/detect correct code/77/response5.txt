The provided code looks mostly correct, but there is one minor syntax issue:

In the FUNCTION declaration, the "TYPE C" should be replaced with "TYPE X". The correct syntax for the EXPORTING parameter should be "TYPE X" to indicate a single character field. The "TYPE C" is used for strings.

Here's the corrected FUNCTION declaration:


FUNCTION Z_ISCUBE.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(A) TYPE  I
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(RETURN_VALUE) TYPE  X
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
...
Other than that, the code appears to be fine and should work as intended. It calculates whether the given number a is a perfect cube or not and sets the RETURN_VALUE parameter accordingly.
