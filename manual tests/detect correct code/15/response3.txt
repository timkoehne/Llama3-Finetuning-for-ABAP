Yes, there is a syntax error in the given code. The issue is with the line:

makefile

lv_str = sy-index - 1.

The variable sy-index is not defined in the code, and it seems like it is intended to be a loop index. However, you cannot use sy-index as a loop index inside a function. Instead, you should use a local loop index variable. Here's the corrected code:

abap

FUNCTION z_string_sequence.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(N) TYPE  I
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(RETURN_VALUE) TYPE  STRING
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------

  DATA lv_str TYPE STRING.
  DATA lv_index TYPE I.

  DO n + 1 TIMES.
    lv_index = sy-index - 1.
    lv_str = lv_index.
    CONCATENATE return_value lv_str INTO return_value.
  ENDDO.

ENDFUNCTION.

In this corrected code, we introduced a new variable lv_index to use as the loop index, and lv_str is assigned the value of lv_index, which is then concatenated with return_value.
