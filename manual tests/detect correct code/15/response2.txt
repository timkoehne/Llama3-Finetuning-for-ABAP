Yes, there are syntax errors in the given code. Here are the issues:

    In the function definition, the "VALUE(N) TYPE I" in the "IMPORTING" section should be changed to "VALUE(N)" as there is no need to specify the data type "I" for N. The correct syntax should be:

sql

FUNCTION z_string_sequence.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(N)
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(RETURN_VALUE) TYPE STRING
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the DO loop, there should be a space between "n" and "+ 1" for proper syntax. The correct syntax should be:

vbnet

DO n + 1 TIMES.

Other than these two issues, the code seems fine. With these corrections, the function should work as intended.
