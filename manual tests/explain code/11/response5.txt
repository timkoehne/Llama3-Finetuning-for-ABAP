This ABAP code defines a custom function named "Z_STRING_XOR" that performs a bitwise XOR operation on two input strings of equal length. The function takes two input parameters IV_A and IV_B, both of type STRING, and it returns the result of the XOR operation as the output parameter RV_RESULT, which is also of type STRING.

Let's break down the code step by step:

DATA declarations: The code declares local variables lv_result, lv_length_a, lv_length_b, and lv_index of type STRING and i (integer) respectively.

Length calculation: It calculates the lengths of the input strings IV_A and IV_B using the STRLEN function and stores them in lv_length_a and lv_length_b, respectively.

Length check: It checks if the lengths of both input strings are equal. If they are not equal, it displays an error message using the MESSAGE statement with type 'E' (error) and exits the function using RETURN.

XOR operation: If the lengths of the input strings are equal, it proceeds to perform the XOR operation character by character. The DO loop iterates lv_length_a times, which is the length of the input strings.

Character comparison: Within the loop, it compares each character of IV_A and IV_B at the current index (lv_index) using the expressions iv_a+lv_index(1) and iv_b+lv_index(1). The +lv_index(1) syntax allows accessing the individual characters at the specified index.

Concatenation: Depending on the comparison result (equal or not equal), the corresponding bit (0 for equal, 1 for not equal) is appended to the RV_RESULT string using the CONCATENATE statement.

Loop increment: After each iteration, the lv_index is incremented by 1, moving to the next character in the input strings for the next iteration.

End of function: The ENDFUNCTION statement marks the end of the function definition.

To summarize, this ABAP function takes two input strings IV_A and IV_B of equal length, compares their characters bit by bit using the XOR operation, and stores the result in the output parameter RV_RESULT. The resulting string RV_RESULT will have the same length as the input strings and will contain '0' where the characters in IV_A and IV_B are equal, and '1' where they are different.
