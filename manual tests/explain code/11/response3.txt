This ABAP code defines a function called "Z_STRING_XOR" that performs the bitwise XOR operation on two input strings, "IV_A" and "IV_B," and stores the result in the output string "RV_RESULT." The function assumes that both input strings have the same length and performs the XOR operation character by character.

Let's break down the code step by step:

The function takes two input parameters, "IV_A" and "IV_B," both of data type "STRING," and one output parameter, "RV_RESULT," also of data type "STRING."

Three local variables are declared: "lv_result" (to store the result of the XOR operation), "lv_length_a" (to store the length of the input string "IV_A"), and "lv_length_b" (to store the length of the input string "IV_B").

The lengths of the input strings "IV_A" and "IV_B" are calculated using the "strlen" function and stored in the variables "lv_length_a" and "lv_length_b."

The code checks if both input strings have the same length using an "IF" statement. If the lengths are not the same, it raises an error message using the "MESSAGE" statement and terminates the function using "RETURN."

If the lengths of "IV_A" and "IV_B" are the same, the function proceeds to perform the bitwise XOR operation.

A loop is initiated using the "DO" statement to iterate "lv_length_a" times. This loop iterates over each character of the input strings.

Within the loop, the function compares the characters at the current index position (indicated by "lv_index") of "IV_A" and "IV_B." If the characters are the same, it means their binary representation has a "0" in the corresponding bit position. In this case, the function appends a "0" to the "RV_RESULT" using the "CONCATENATE" statement. Otherwise, if the characters are different, it means their binary representation has a "1" in the corresponding bit position, and the function appends a "1" to the "RV_RESULT."

After each iteration, "lv_index" is incremented to move to the next character in the input strings.

The loop continues until all characters of the input strings have been processed.

Finally, the function ends, and the output "RV_RESULT" contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation, which is the binary representation of the XORed values of "IV_A" and "IV_B."

In summary, this ABAP function performs a bitwise XOR operation on two input strings and returns the binary representation of the XORed result in the output string "RV_RESULT." It assumes that both input strings have the same length; otherwise, it raises an error message.
