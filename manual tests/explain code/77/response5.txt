This ABAP function, named Z_ISCUBE, takes an input parameter A (of type I, which stands for integer) and determines whether A is a perfect cube or not. It returns 'X' in the exporting parameter RETURN_VALUE if A is a perfect cube, otherwise, it returns a blank space (' ').

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The function declares three local variables:

abs_a: This variable will store the absolute value of the input parameter A.
root_a: This variable will store the cube root of abs_a.
cube_a: This variable will store the cube of root_a.
Calculate the absolute value of A and store it in abs_a using the ABS function.

Calculate the cube root of abs_a and store it in root_a using the ** operator with an exponent of (1 / 3). This calculation is based on the mathematical property that raising a number to the power of 1/3 is equivalent to taking its cube root.

Calculate the cube of root_a and store it in cube_a using the ** operator with an exponent of 3. This step squares root_a to obtain the cube.

Compare cube_a with abs_a to check if the cube of the cube root is equal to the original value (A). If they are equal, it means that A is a perfect cube.

Set the value of the exporting parameter RETURN_VALUE accordingly:

If cube_a is equal to abs_a, set RETURN_VALUE to 'X', indicating that A is a perfect cube.
If cube_a is not equal to abs_a, set RETURN_VALUE to a blank space (' '), indicating that A is not a perfect cube.
Finally, the function returns, and the result (either 'X' or a blank space) can be retrieved through the RETURN_VALUE parameter after calling the function with an appropriate value for the input parameter A.
