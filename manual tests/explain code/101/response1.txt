his ABAP code defines a function called "Z_WORDS_STRING," which takes an input string and splits it into multiple parts based on a delimiter (in this case, the comma ','), and then stores the individual parts into an output internal table. Let's break down the code step by step:

Function Declaration:

FUNCTION Z_WORDS_STRING.
This line declares the function "Z_WORDS_STRING."

Function Interface:
The function has two parameters defined in its interface:

a. IMPORTING parameter INPUT_STRING of type STRING:
This parameter is used to pass the input string to the function, which is the string that needs to be split.

b. EXPORTING parameter OUTPUT_TABLE of type STRINGTAB:
This parameter is used to return the results of the split operation. It is of type STRINGTAB, which is an internal table of strings. The individual parts of the input string will be stored as entries in this table.

SPLIT Statement:


SPLIT input_string AT ',' INTO TABLE output_table.
The SPLIT statement is used to divide the INPUT_STRING into multiple segments based on the given delimiter ',' (comma). The resulting parts will be stored in the OUTPUT_TABLE.

Let's understand the SPLIT statement in detail:

SPLIT: This is the keyword that initiates the splitting operation.
input_string: This is the variable representing the input string that needs to be split. It is specified using the IMPORTING parameter INPUT_STRING.
AT ',': This part specifies the delimiter to be used for the splitting operation. In this case, it is the comma ','.
INTO TABLE output_table: This part indicates that the split parts should be stored in the OUTPUT_TABLE. The INTO TABLE keyword is used to specify that the results should be placed into the internal table output_table.
After the SPLIT statement executes, the individual parts of the INPUT_STRING that were separated by commas will be stored in the OUTPUT_TABLE, which is then returned to the calling program through the EXPORTING parameter OUTPUT_TABLE.

For example, if the input string is "apple,orange,banana" and the function is called with this input, the OUTPUT_TABLE will contain three entries: "apple," "orange," and "banana" as separate strings.

Finally, the function ends with the ENDFUNCTION statement, which marks the end of the function definition.
