The code appears to be a function called Z_ISCUBE that takes an input parameter A of type I (integer) and checks whether the absolute value of A is a perfect cube or not. It returns 'X' if A is a perfect cube; otherwise, it returns a space ' '.

The code logic seems mostly correct, but there is a potential issue with floating-point accuracy when calculating the root_a variable. The expression root_a = abs_a ** (1 / 3) may lead to inaccurate results due to floating-point representation.

To address this issue, you can use the POW function, which is more accurate for floating-point calculations:

Replace this line:

ABAP

root_a = abs_a ** (1 / 3).

With this line:

ABAP

root_a = POW( abs_a, 1 / 3 ).

The POW function raises abs_a to the power of 1 / 3, which is equivalent to taking the cube root of abs_a and will give you a more accurate result.
