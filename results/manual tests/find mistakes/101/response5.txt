In the provided code, the mistake is that the OUTPUT_TABLE parameter is defined as an exporting parameter but is not being assigned any value before the function ends. Since it's an exporting parameter, it should have a value assigned to it before the function is completed so that the calling program can access the result.

To fix the code, you need to populate the OUTPUT_TABLE with the values of the TABLE variable before the function ends. Here's the corrected code:

abap

FUNCTION Z_WORDS_STRING.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(INPUT_STRING) TYPE  STRING
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(OUTPUT_TABLE) TYPE  STRINGTAB
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------

  SPLIT input_string AT ',' INTO TABLE table.

  OUTPUT_TABLE = table.

ENDFUNCTION.

With this modification, the OUTPUT_TABLE will now contain the words extracted from the INPUT_STRING, and it will be available for use in the calling program.
