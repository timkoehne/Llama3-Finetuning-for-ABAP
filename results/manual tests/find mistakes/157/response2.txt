The mistake in this code is the incorrect variable names used for calculating the squares of a, b, and c. The variable names squarea, square_b, and square_c are used for storing the squared values, but the actual calculations are performed using square_a, square_b, and square_c. This will result in a runtime error, and the code won't work as intended.

To fix the issue, you need to use consistent variable names for the calculations and the storage. Here's the corrected code:

abap

FUNCTION z_right_angle_triangle.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(A) TYPE  I
*"     VALUE(B) TYPE  I
*"     VALUE(C) TYPE  I
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(RETURN_VALUE) TYPE  C
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------

  DATA: square_a TYPE i,
        square_b TYPE i,
        square_c TYPE i.

  square_a = a * a.
  square_b = b * b.
  square_c = c * c.

  return_value = ' '.
  IF square_a = square_b + square_c OR square_b = square_a + square_c OR square_c = square_a + square_b.
    return_value = 'X'.
  ENDIF.

ENDFUNCTION.

Now the code should work correctly, calculating and comparing the squares of the input values to check if they form a right-angled triangle.
