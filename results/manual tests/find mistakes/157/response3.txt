The code seems to be attempting to determine if the given input values (A, B, and C) form a right-angled triangle. However, there is a mistake in the code related to the comparison of the squares of the sides.

The mistake is in the "IF" condition that checks for a right-angled triangle. The condition is incorrectly written, and it will not give the correct result for all cases.

To correctly check if the given sides (A, B, and C) form a right-angled triangle, the condition should be modified to:

abap

IF square_a = square_b + square_c OR square_b = square_a + square_c OR square_c = square_a + square_b.
  return_value = abap_true.
ENDIF.

The mistake was missing the "=" sign in the condition, which should compare the squares of the sides with the sum of the squares of the other two sides. With the corrected condition, the function should work correctly to determine if the input values represent a right-angled triangle.
