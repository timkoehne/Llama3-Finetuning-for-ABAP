The provided code appears to be ABAP code (a programming language used in SAP systems). As far as syntax errors are concerned, I don't see any obvious ones in the code snippet. However, I can't guarantee that the code will function as intended without additional context or the full program.

If there are any issues with this code, they might be related to logic errors or data type mismatches depending on the usage of this function in the larger context of the program. Additionally, there might be some issues if this function is called with invalid input values or if the data types used in the function don't match the data types expected in the calling program.

To fully validate the code and ensure it works as intended, you should test it with various input values and consider the entire program's logic and structure. Also, make sure the function is called correctly with the appropriate data types for the input and output parameters.
