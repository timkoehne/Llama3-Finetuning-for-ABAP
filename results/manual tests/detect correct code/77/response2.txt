Based on the provided code, I don't see any obvious syntax errors. However, there is a potential issue with the data types used for the variables abs_a, root_a, and cube_a. The ABS function returns a floating-point number, and the exponentiation operations may also result in floating-point numbers. However, the variables are declared with the data type i, which is for integers.

To ensure compatibility and avoid any runtime issues, you should consider using the appropriate data types for these variables. For example, you could change the data type to f for floating-point numbers:


  DATA: abs_a    TYPE f,
        root_a   TYPE f,
        cube_a   TYPE f.
With this change, the code should work as expected and calculate whether the input number a is a perfect cube or not.
