Based on the given code snippet, there doesn't appear to be any syntax errors. The code defines a function named "Z_ISCUBE" with appropriate import and export parameters. It calculates the cube root of the absolute value of the input parameter "a" and then checks if the result, when cubed, is equal to the absolute value of "a." Depending on the comparison, it sets the "RETURN_VALUE" parameter to 'X' or blank.

However, it's worth noting that without the entire context of the program, we cannot be sure if there are any issues related to variable declarations, scope, or potential logical errors that might arise during the runtime. To definitively confirm the absence of errors, it's best to test the code in an appropriate environment.
