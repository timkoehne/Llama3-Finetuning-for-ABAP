Based on the provided code, there don't seem to be any obvious syntax errors. However, I can't see the full context of the code, including any possible variable declarations or the calling code, so there might be issues in the broader context.

To ensure that the code works correctly, you may want to check the following:

Ensure that the function parameters are correctly defined and used. For example, check if the variable "a" is correctly passed to the function.

Make sure that all used variables are correctly declared with the appropriate data types before this code snippet.

Verify that the importing and exporting parameters match the calling code or other parts of the program where this function is used.

Check for any missing or unnecessary periods, commas, or parentheses.

Verify that the function is called correctly in the program.

Without the broader context and the complete code, it's challenging to detect other potential issues or how this function will be integrated into the overall program. If you encounter any specific errors or issues, please provide more context or error messages, and I'll be happy to assist further.
