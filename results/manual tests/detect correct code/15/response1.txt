Yes, there is a syntax error in the given code. The error is in the line:

sql

CONCATENATE return_value lv_str INTO return_value.

In ABAP, when you use the CONCATENATE statement, you cannot concatenate a value directly into one of its source operands. In this case, return_value is used as both the target and one of the source operands.

To fix the error, you can use a temporary variable to hold the concatenated result and then assign it back to return_value:

abap

DATA: lv_temp TYPE string.

DO n + 1 TIMES.
  lv_str = sy-index - 1.
  CONCATENATE return_value lv_str INTO lv_temp.
  return_value = lv_temp.
ENDDO.

With this change, the syntax error should be resolved, and the code should work as intended.
