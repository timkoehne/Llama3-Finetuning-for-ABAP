The given code appears to be ABAP code, and upon inspection, I don't see any syntax errors in the code snippet you provided. The code defines a function called "z_right_angle_triangle," which takes three input parameters (A, B, and C) of type I (integer) and one output parameter (RETURN_VALUE) of type C (character).

The code calculates the squares of the three input values (a, b, and c) and stores them in local variables square_a, square_b, and square_c, respectively. Then, it checks whether the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to the square of the third side. If this condition is met for any combination of sides, it sets the value of RETURN_VALUE to 'X'.

Overall, the code seems to be syntactically correct. However, keep in mind that there might be logical issues depending on the requirements of the function and how it will be used in your application. For example, it's worth considering what will happen when the input values A, B, and C are zero or negative. Proper handling of edge cases is important for a robust implementation.
