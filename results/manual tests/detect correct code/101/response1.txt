The given code appears to be ABAP code for a function module. Based on the code snippet, there is one syntax error:

The keyword "FUNCTION" should be written in lowercase. ABAP keywords are case-insensitive, and it is a standard practice to write them in lowercase.
Corrected code:


function z_words_string.
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------
*"*"Local Interface:
*"  IMPORTING
*"     VALUE(INPUT_STRING) TYPE  STRING
*"  EXPORTING
*"     VALUE(OUTPUT_TABLE) TYPE  STRINGTAB
*"----------------------------------------------------------------------

  SPLIT input_string AT ',' INTO TABLE output_table.

endfunction.
With the correction, the syntax of the ABAP function module should be correct. However, it's essential to ensure that the rest of the program calling this function module is also correctly implemented.
