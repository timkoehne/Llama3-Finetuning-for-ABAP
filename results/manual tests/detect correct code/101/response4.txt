The code you provided appears to be written in ABAP, and it seems to define a function named "Z_WORDS_STRING." At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any syntax errors in the code snippet you shared.

However, since I cannot run the code, I can't guarantee that it will work perfectly as intended without any context or complete code.

If you encounter any issues while using this code, make sure to check the calling code and the data types used for the parameters to ensure they match correctly. Additionally, check the actual implementation of the function to ensure it meets your specific requirements.
