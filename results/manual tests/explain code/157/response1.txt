This ABAP function is named "z_right_angle_triangle" and checks if a triangle is a right-angled triangle given the lengths of its sides. A right-angled triangle is a triangle where one of the angles is a right angle (90 degrees).

Let's break down the code:

The function "z_right_angle_triangle" has three input parameters: "A," "B," and "C," each of type "I" (integer). These parameters represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

There is one output parameter, "RETURN_VALUE," of type "C" (character). This parameter is used to indicate whether the triangle is a right-angled triangle or not. If the value is 'X', it means the triangle is a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it will be ' ' (a single blank space).

Three local variables, "square_a," "square_b," and "square_c," of type "I" (integer) are declared to store the squares of sides A, B, and C, respectively.

The squares of the sides are calculated and stored in the corresponding variables: "square_a = a * a," "square_b = b * b," and "square_c = c * c."

The variable "return_value" is initialized with a blank space ' '.

The IF condition checks whether any of the squares of two sides are equal to the square of the third side. If any of these conditions are true, it means the triangle is a right-angled triangle (by the Pythagorean theorem). In that case, the "return_value" is set to 'X'.

The function ends with the "ENDFUNCTION" statement.

In summary, this ABAP function takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input and determines if the triangle is a right-angled triangle. It does so by checking if any of the three conditions (squared side equals the sum of squares of other two sides) are true. If any condition is true, the function sets the output parameter "RETURN_VALUE" to 'X', indicating that the triangle is a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it remains ' ' (blank space), implying that the triangle is not a right-angled triangle.
