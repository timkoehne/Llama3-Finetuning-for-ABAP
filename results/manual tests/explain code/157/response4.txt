This ABAP code defines a function module named "z_right_angle_triangle," which checks if the input values A, B, and C form a right-angled triangle. The function module takes three input parameters (A, B, and C) of type integer (I) and returns a single output parameter named RETURN_VALUE of type character (C).

Let's break down the code step-by-step:

Declaration of Local Interface:
The function module has a local interface section that defines the parameters passed into the function (IMPORTING) and the result to be returned (EXPORTING).

IMPORTING: It specifies three integer values, A, B, and C, which are the sides of the triangle.
EXPORTING: It includes the RETURN_VALUE parameter, which is a character variable ('X' or ' ') representing whether the input values form a right-angled triangle or not.
Local Data Declarations:
Three local variables are declared to store the squares of the input sides A, B, and C.

square_a, square_b, square_c: These are integer variables to hold the squares of A, B, and C, respectively.
Calculation of Squares:
The code then calculates the squares of A, B, and C by multiplying each side with itself.

square_a = a * a: Calculates the square of A.
square_b = b * b: Calculates the square of B.
square_c = c * c: Calculates the square of C.
Initialize RETURN_VALUE:
The RETURN_VALUE is initialized with a space (' ') character. It means that initially, the function assumes the given triangle is not a right-angled triangle.

Check for Right-Angled Triangle:
The code uses an IF statement to check whether the given input sides form a right-angled triangle. It does so by comparing the squares of the three sides with each other.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, the IF condition checks if any of the three squares is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
Set RETURN_VALUE:
If the IF condition evaluates to true, it means that the input sides A, B, and C form a right-angled triangle. In such a case, the RETURN_VALUE is set to 'X'.

The code then ends the function module without any explicit RETURN statement, as the EXPORTING parameter RETURN_VALUE is set within the function, and its value will be available after the function is called.

To summarize, this ABAP function module, z_right_angle_triangle, takes three integer input parameters representing the sides of a triangle and returns a character ('X' or ' ') indicating whether the triangle is a right-angled triangle or not based on the Pythagorean theorem.
