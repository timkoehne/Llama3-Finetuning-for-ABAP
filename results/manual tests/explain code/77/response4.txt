This ABAP code defines a function module named "Z_ISCUBE" that checks whether a given input number is a perfect cube or not. The function takes an integer input "A" and returns a single character value "RETURN_VALUE" indicating whether the number is a perfect cube or not.

Let's break down the code step by step:

The function interface:
The function module "Z_ISCUBE" has two parameters:
IMPORTING parameter "A": This parameter is used to pass an integer value to the function.
EXPORTING parameter "RETURN_VALUE": This parameter is used to return a single character value ('X' or ' ') indicating whether the number is a perfect cube ('X') or not (' ').
Local variables:
Three local variables are declared within the function:
"abs_a": This variable stores the absolute value of the input number "A" using the ABS function.
"root_a": This variable stores the cube root of "abs_a" using the calculation "abs_a ** (1 / 3)".
"cube_a": This variable stores the cube of "root_a" using the calculation "root_a ** 3".
Calculations:
"abs_a = ABS( a ).": The absolute value of the input "A" is stored in the variable "abs_a" to handle negative input numbers.
"root_a = abs_a ** ( 1 / 3 ).": The cube root of "abs_a" is calculated and stored in the variable "root_a".
"cube_a = root_a ** 3.": The cube of "root_a" is calculated and stored in the variable "cube_a".
Checking if the number is a perfect cube:
"if cube_a = abs_a.": This condition checks if the cube of "root_a" (stored in "cube_a") is equal to the original absolute value of "A" (stored in "abs_a"). If these values are equal, it means that the original number "A" is a perfect cube.
"return_value = 'X'.": If "A" is a perfect cube, the "RETURN_VALUE" parameter is set to 'X' to indicate that.
"else.": If "A" is not a perfect cube, the code within the "else" block is executed.
"return_value = ' '.": In this case, the "RETURN_VALUE" parameter is set to space (' ') to indicate that "A" is not a perfect cube.
The function ends with "ENDFUNCTION.": This statement marks the end of the function module "Z_ISCUBE."
In summary, this ABAP function module takes an integer input "A," calculates the cube root and cube of the absolute value of "A," and then compares the cube to the original absolute value to determine if "A" is a perfect cube. The result ('X' or ' ') is returned in the "RETURN_VALUE" parameter.
