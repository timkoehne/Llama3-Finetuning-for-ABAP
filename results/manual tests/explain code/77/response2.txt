This ABAP code defines a function module named "Z_ISCUBE" that checks if a given number is a perfect cube. Here's an explanation of the code:

The function module has two interfaces:

IMPORTING: It takes one input parameter "A" of type I (integer).
EXPORTING: It returns the result in "RETURN_VALUE" of type C (character, length 1).
Local Data Declarations:

"abs_a": This variable stores the absolute value of the input parameter "A".
"root_a": This variable stores the cube root of "abs_a".
"cube_a": This variable stores the cube of "root_a".
Code Execution:

"abs_a = ABS( a ).": This line calculates the absolute value of the input parameter "A" and stores it in the variable "abs_a".
"root_a = abs_a ** ( 1 / 3 ).": This line calculates the cube root of "abs_a" and stores it in the variable "root_a".
"cube_a = root_a ** 3.": This line calculates the cube of "root_a" and stores it in the variable "cube_a".
Comparison and Result:

"if cube_a = abs_a.": This line checks if the calculated cube ("cube_a") is equal to the original absolute value of "A" ("abs_a").
"return_value = 'X'.": If the cube of "root_a" is equal to the absolute value of "A," the result is set to 'X', indicating that the input number is a perfect cube.
"else.": If the cube of "root_a" is not equal to the absolute value of "A," the following lines are executed:
"return_value = ' '.": In this case, the result is set to a blank space, indicating that the input number is not a perfect cube.
End of the Function Module:

"ENDFUNCTION.": This statement marks the end of the function module.
In summary, the ABAP function module "Z_ISCUBE" calculates the cube root and cube of the input parameter "A" and compares the cube with the original value. If they are equal, it sets the export parameter "RETURN_VALUE" to 'X', indicating that the input number is a perfect cube; otherwise, it sets it to a blank space, indicating that the input number is not a perfect cube.
